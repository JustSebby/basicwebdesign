        <h3> Random Facts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> Scott Cawthon (The Creator of FNaF) conceived the idea of FNaF based on criticism of his previous game, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt16243242%2F&psig=AOvVaw32oqsZzOaBFqxBl-px68kS&ust=1734052218507000&source=images&cd=vfe&opi=89978449&ved=0CBQQjRxqFwoTCNjF6oqGoYoDFQAAAAAdAAAAABA5" >Chipper and Sons Lumber Co.</a> Reviewers complained on frightening chararcters that had animatronic-like movement which inspired Scott Cawthon to create a scarier experience. </li>
            <li> The Concept of FNaF is simiar to a 2006 comedy film <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477347/">Night at the Museum</a>. <li>
            <li>Scott Cawthon was scared of Bonnie as he had plenty of nightmares when developing FNaF 1.</li>
             <li> On rare occasions when starting up the game or after the game over screen there's a 0.1% of <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizza/images/3/3c/BonnieRareScreen_Pupils_HD.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/1000?cb=20230810152925" target="_blank">Bonnie with white pupils.</a>
